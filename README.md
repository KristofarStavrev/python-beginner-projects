# Python Beginner Projects

Beginner projects that I created while learning Python and the basic priciples of programming and OOP. To run the projects you can clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/KrythonS/python-simple-projects.git` and execute the respective `.py` script. There are no additional dependencies that need to be installed beforehand.
